# C-Sharp-Live-Project
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I have participated in a live project with other students at the Tech Academy for the past two weeks. We added onto an ongoing MVC and .NET web application that had a theatre theme. My tasks during these two weeks have been to create a section for the website specifically for blog posts where authors can write and post their own content. I worked on several backend and frontend stories related to this model and gained a lot of experience working with a development team to make the website look and function well.<p>
<p>Below I have some descriptions of the backend and frontend stories I worked on during this project, as well as links to images of the code.</p>
<h2>Back End Stories</h2>
<li>Creating the Model</li>
<li>Creating CRUD Pages</li>
<h2>Creating the Model</h2>
<p>This story had me create a Model called "BlogPost" that had different properties like Title, Datetime Posted, Author, and Content. Setting these properties in a class created the basis of what a blog post would be for the website.</p>
<p>BlogPost Model Class: (https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111891542/210115580-0938b691-c7f8-4bd1-8e3e-8a814d3bdcb3.png)
<h2>Creating the CRUD Pages</h2>
<p>After creating the BlogPost model, I scaffolded the Create, Read, Update, Delete pages using Visual Studio with Entity Framework. It made the layout of each page automatically and I customized each page afterwards to better fit the project. Here is the final product of the CRUD pages using HTML and C#.</p>

<p>Delete Page: (https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111891542/210116178-38a63123-a5ae-490b-8b55-404f83bdc6b6.png)</p>
<h2>Front End Stories</h2>
<p>After creating these pages, I mostly had frontend tasks to work on to make the pages a certain style that was requested. I had a set number of colors to use and images of what type of look was needed for certain pages like the "create" form for blog posts.</p>
<li>Styling Index Page</li>
<li>Styling Create and Edit Pages</li>
<h2>Styling Index Page</h2>
<p>This story allowed me to style an index page for all of the blogposts in the database. I was asked to add a placeholder image for each post until that function would be added. I styled the page using Bootstrap and CSS to give each post their own container with the image on the left side and the BlogPost properties on the right side. The color scheme is also cordinated from the selection I was given.</p>
<p>Index Page: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111891542/210116899-212c7c82-b814-48a3-8cfd-93b8a02ec732.png)</p>
<h2>Styling Create And Edit Pages</h2>
<p>Then, I styled both the create and edit pages to look the same. They are both in a form format where the user can either create a new post or edit the details of a post from the index page. I added slight effects (hover, subtle color changes) for the buttons and made each textbox border change color when clicked on.</p>

<h2>Other Skills Learned</h2>
<li>Another important topic that I gained experience in was the Agile Framework. Our team of students had daily standup meeting to discuss what we worked on last, currently, and if we had any roadblocks we needed help with. Not only did the daily meetings help us form connections, but we were able to have more productivity because we could set time aside to collaborate ideas and help one another if we needed. This definitely helped me to practice teamwork skills that are super valuable to the workforce! We also had code retrospectives on Fridays to look back on the week and discuss any topics we felt were great or not so great. Overall, this Live Project gave me some valuable experience and I was able to grow my technical and soft skills as a software developer.
