# C-Sharp-Live-Project
<p>I have participated in a live project with other students at the Tech Academy for the past two weeks. We added onto an ongoing MVC and .NET web application that was made for a theatre company. My tasks during these two weeks have been to create a section for the website specifically for blog posts where authors can write and post their own content. I worked on several backend and frontend stories related to this model and gained a lot of experience working with a development team to make the website look and function well.<p>
<p>Below I have some descriptions of the backend and frontend stories I worked on during this project, as well as links to images of the code.</p>
<p>BackEnd Stories</p>
<li>Creating the Model</li>
<li>Creating CRUD Pages</li>
<h2>Creating the Model</h2>
<p>This story had me create a Model called "BlogPost" that had different properties like Title, Datetime Posted, Author, and Content. Setting these properties in a class created the basis of what a blog post would be for the website.</p>
<p>BlogPost Model Class: (https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111891542/210115580-0938b691-c7f8-4bd1-8e3e-8a814d3bdcb3.png)
<h2>Creating the CRUD Pages</h2>
<p>After creating the BlogPost model, I scaffolded the Create, Read, Update, Delete pages using Visual Studio with Entity Framework. It made the layout of each page automatically and I customized each page afterwards to better fit the project. Here is the final product of the CRUD pages using HTML and C#.</p>
